So excited to tell you what hello world is in the world of software engineering is and how big of a component is when it comes to building one’s knowledge and experience skill base. For everyone in the professional ICT field especially the software development part of it, have once or every now and then written a “hello world” program or workflow.

This is because the concept of the hello world is an introductory state in the practical section of the concerned subject matter being a programming language or engineering pattern or framework. It is like the “a, b, c” s of everything in this world of software, because (1) it is used by language or framework designers & engineers to ensure that their work set up is properly organised or installed, (2) it introduces at lowest level the simplest techniques of use of the tool(framework or language) at hand that can achieve the most trial goal ever and (3) lastly in demonstrates to the world the existence of another being both in terms of the artefact that has just been released in the language or framework and the team or the person who achieved that in this new paradigm of things doing.

So next time you see the words “hello world” just appreciate the necessity which compelled their so ever evolving existence and appearance in in your contextual frame of life and know that it pulls in some massive effort to draft even the simplest hi to the girl you love, so in the similar manner appreciation and gratitude shall be paid to the inventors of hello world and their fellow generation of descendants “us” and you the witness to the life of greeting hello the world.
